This is a small crop from a vehicle licence plate: one coloured region
that differs from the plate's background. What is it? Pick one.

- "flag": a national flag
- "text_badge": a box with letters in it (country code, "EV", region code)
- "emblem": coat of arms, seal, round logo
- "sticker": a stuck-on label, inspection sticker or holographic/security
  strip (often small, grey or shimmering, with a faint pattern)
- "band": a plain coloured strip
- "character": part of the plate's own letters or digits
- "noise": a screw, reflection, dirt, the edge or the mount

  "type": "object",
