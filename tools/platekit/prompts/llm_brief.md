## What is left for you

Everything above was produced offline: the article parsed into tables,
each photo fitted, flattened to plate units, measured and colour-balanced.
Trust the numbers over your own reading of a photo; open a photo only when
its fit says CHECK or the numbers contradict the article.

0. Take the categories from "Pictures and their captions" and the
   tables, not from which photos happened to measure: a SKIPPED or NOT
   MEASURED picture whose caption names a current plate is still a
   category — open its original and measure it by hand.
1. Group the categories into designs (one builder per design). Use the
   rows column: same row count and spans means one design.
2. Write `lib/src/{country}_plates.dart` — `_Layout` from the measured rows,
   one builder per design, glyph sizes from ink heights (glyph ≈ ink / 0.72).
3. Write the validators' rules from the table's format column.
4. Write the gallery labels and section notes.
5. Place the icons as "Icons — what to do with them" says.
6. Write the gallery source `plate_number_holder/lib/screens/gallery/sources/{country}.dart`
   and fill the cases map in `test/golden_test.dart` (one line per category).

Already done, do not redo: pubspec, LICENSE, analysis_options, README
(only fix its summary line and the usage example), library export, the
golden test harness.

Done afterwards by `pk after`, do not do: gallery registration, the
gallery render test, goldens, the full test runs, the commit plan. To
check your code while writing, `python3 tools/platekit/pk.py analyze
<package>` is enough. Stop when the code above is written and analyzes
clean.
