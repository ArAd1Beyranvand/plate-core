# plate_core

A plate here is just a `const PlateSpec`: some geometry, a country panel, and a row of
slots over alphabets. The widget layer paints whatever the spec says, so adding a plate
means adding a const - never a widget, never a subclass, never a meeting.

`plate_core` knows no country and ships no assets. It hands you the plate face, the
slots, the input machine, and a `PlateValidator` that gives opinions but never blocks a
keystroke. The actual countries live in their own packages.

## Install

```yaml
dependencies:
  plate_core: ^0.5.0
```

Then pick a country package (`iran_plate`, `germany_plate`, `palestine_plate`,
`yemen_plate`) and, if you want the on-screen keyboard, `plate_keypad`. The repo's
`plate_gallery/` app draws every plate all four of them ship, in one place.

## Use

```dart
import 'package:plate_core/plate_core.dart';
import 'package:iran_plate/iran_plate.dart';

PlateCanvas(
  spec: IranPlates.civil,
  onChooseCharacter: (alphabet) async => null,
)
```

That is a complete, editable plate. It needs **nothing above it** — no provider, no
bloc. A `PlateCanvas` owns its characters in a `PlateController` (a `ChangeNotifier`,
no dependency beyond Flutter); pass `controller:` when you want to read or write the
value, track the active slot, or feed characters from your own keypad. It brings its
own `Material`, so it survives outside a `Scaffold`.

Swapping `spec:` on a live canvas now **carries the value across** to the new spec,
matching registers by group key — `onSpecChange` tunes that.

If the code around your plate is already bloc-shaped, `plate_core_bloc` provides a
`PlateCardBloc` mirrored onto the controller; nothing in `plate_core` depends on it.

## Things it refuses to do

- Know a country. Grep `lib/` for a country name; a hit is a bug.
- Police input. The validator can paint the frame red. It cannot stop you typing.
- Own your keyboard. Feed it characters from wherever you like.
- Choose your state management. A plate holds its own characters in a
  `PlateController`. Bloc-shaped hosts add `plate_core_bloc`; core neither knows nor
  asks.

## API

Whatever `package:plate_core/plate_core.dart` exports is API. Anything under
`lib/src/` that the barrel doesn't re-export is ours to change without warning.
