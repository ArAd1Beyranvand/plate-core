/// **Yemen has two current plate systems, not one current and one legacy.**
/// System A is the 2026 unified white plate (light blue side panel, 4–6 digit number,
/// two-digit side code). System B is the 1993 northern format (stacked registers split
/// by a rule, 1–2 digit governorate code, up to 6-digit serial, colour-coded by usage).
/// The two are separate namespaces; usage picks a country block and a theme at render
/// time.
///
/// The south issues its own: Aden's lighthouse plate, Taiz's temporary plate,
/// and the coloured-strip plates of Hadhramaut, Al Mahrah, Shabwah and Marib.
/// Those are measured off the Wikipedia artwork; the rest is not:
///
/// Every dimension and colour is marked `// CALIBRATE` — proportioned from photographs,
/// not measured from a standard.
