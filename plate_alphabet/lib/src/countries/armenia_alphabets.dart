/// **Armenian plates are printed in Latin letters, and always were** — but not
/// because the country writes its registrations in Latin. The four letters the
/// system opened with in 1996 were chosen for their *shapes*: `Լ`/`L`, `Ս`
/// (which reads `s` and looks like `U`), `Տ` (which reads `t` and looks like
/// `S`) and `Օ` (which reads `ô` and looks like `O`). An Armenian read them as
/// Armenian and a foreigner read them as Latin, and the plate did not have to
/// choose. Every letter added since is a plain Latin one with no Armenian
/// counterpart at all, and by 2019 all twenty-six were in use.
///
/// That is why [letters] is simply A-Z and carries no [PlateAlphabet.glyphs]:
/// on a modern plate there is nothing to transliterate. The Armenian script
/// survives on exactly one design — the military plate, whose `ՊՆ` and class
/// letter are Armenian and are not doubling for anything Latin. It gets
/// [militaryClass], the only alphabet here that renders a script.
