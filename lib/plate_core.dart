/// Data-driven vehicle licence plates for Flutter.
///
/// A plate is a `const` [PlateSpec]: canvas geometry, a country panel, slots
/// over alphabets, and optional chrome. The widget layer paints whatever a spec
/// describes, so adding a plate means adding a const, never a widget.
///
/// Deliberate non-goals:
///
/// - **No country knowledge.** Nothing here names a country and no assets ship
///   with it; plates, alphabets and flags live in each country's own package.
///   A country name in this package, even in a comment, is a bug.
/// - **No input policing.** A [PlateValidator] answers "is this plate valid?"
///   and never bars a keystroke. The one exception is a
///   [PlateRestriction] a spec declares, which is refused everywhere.
/// - **No keyboard ownership.** [PlateInputSource] lets the host feed
///   characters from its own UI through a [PlateController].
/// - **No state-management opinion.** A plate holds its characters in a
///   [PlateController], a [ChangeNotifier] with no dependency beyond Flutter.
///
/// Anything under `src/` this file does not export is an implementation detail
/// — in particular the input state machine, the slot widget and the frame.
